### Change Log
#### Version 1.6.0-pre.3
Fixed an issue that prevented some in-world block/item conversions under certain conditions.

Fixed an issue that prevented the log barrel creation from being processed on the server.

Fixed an issue that caused scraping for resin to produce a debarked log instead.

Added unique sounds to the primitive barrel.

#### Version 1.6.0-pre.2
Fixed a crash that occurred when a player would smash the bark stack with a tool and the bark stack was not a multiple of 4

Fixed a crash that occurred when interacting with logs that have no directional resin block

Fixed a brigadine armor recipe error 

Added a sound effect for bark stack smashing

#### Version 1.6.0-pre.1
Buckskin/Brain Tanning
Buckskin is now the resulting product from the brain tanning method.

Buckskin can be crafted into three different articles of clothing: Warshirt, Breechcloth, and Moccasins

Bark Tanning
All variants of bark can now be piled into stacks.

Using a mallet or axe, bark piles can be attacked to create 'bark chunks'.

Bark chunks can be soaked in water, inside a barrel, to create 'Weak Bark Liquor', and further bark chinks can be soaked to create 'Strong Bark Liquor'. This process is the same as the vanilla crafting of oak tannin.

Just like in vanilla, scraped hides can be soaked TWICE in the two different liquor strengths to create leather. The difference with the bark tanning technique is that the hides will adopt the colour of the bark used for tanning.

Introduced tree-typed variants of leather. These typed leathers can be crafted into coloured variants of backpacks, leather armor, and jerkin. 

Typed leathers can still be used to craft antler mounts, books, etc. HOWEVER, not ALL things can be crafted with it yet. More recipes should come for the official launch of the mod.

Bark Ash
Bark Ash has been implemented as an alternative for lime in leather crafting. 

Bark Ash can be created by stacking 32 bark in a pit kiln and fired.

Bark Ash can be used as fertilizer for crops.

Misc
Primitive Barrels, which is a low-capacity barrel carved from a log, can be created via in-world crafting with an adze.

Grindables in the mortar can now be ground with a like-item in the players hand, instead of just while they have an empty hand.

Pitch torches can now be picked up with an empty hand by using right click.

Salve and pitch containers can now be picked up with an empty hand by using right click.

All Ancient Tools hides and bark breads have been moved from the GAME domain and into the ANCIENT TOOLS domain. 

Adze tool logic has been shifted into a block behavior.

Fauna of the Stone Age mod compatibility has been removed. Those mods will handle the compatibility instead.

Directional Resin block drops have been changed to 'dropsByType' for better compatibility.

Fixed an issue that caused fat behaviors to be overwritten.

Updated CollectibleBehaviorIngredientConverstion logic to allow the conversion to occur to full blocks, and not just ground storage items. 

Adjusted various renderers to utilize MultiTextureMeshes, which should help reduce texture atlas overflow

#### Version 1.5.25
Bark Baskets can now be placed on rafts and boats. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: Break or place your bark baskets in the crafting grid to update them! NOT doing this will result in any basket being placed on a boat to cause a crash loop! To fix the crashing, either disable this mod OR set `enabled:false,` in the barkbasket.json file found within `assets/ancienttools/blocktypes/`, then reload the world. The broken basket will be flushed from the boat inventory automatically and you will be fine to reload with the mod installed. If you don't care about using them for boats, feel free to continue using them as is.

Fixed an issue that gave regular torches the ability to stay lit in the rain, just like pitch torches.

Fixed a patch that caused Resin and Raw Hides to lose the ability to be ground stored.

Added a config variable to allow players to disable the vanilla hide scraping recipe while still allowing players to use the vanilla tanning method.

Added a 'Created By' info button to hides involved in Native American Tanning and the hide sacks to point players towards the Native American tanning method added by Ancient Tools. 

Removed compatibility for Bricklayers. Many things Ancient Tools relied on have been shifted between Bricklayers and Expanded Matter that this compatibility relied on, causing numerous crashes. I'd rather remove it now and focus on a companion mod for compatibility in the future.

#### Version 1.5.24
Provided an attribute on the SplitLog that allows other mods that add wood variants to supply drops for the wedge smacking process. This does nothing different on its own. Floral Zones mods will be getting updates to patch this in and solve existing crashes.

#### Version 1.5.23
Fixed an issue with the split logs that caused game sounds to disappear. Thanks to Agzil and Oscar for the detailed context of the issue, it helped immensely.

#### Version 1.5.22
Brain drops should now work again. All patches made to vanilla creature drops now do it through behaviorConfigs, which are new in VS 1.20(I think?). This no longer requires an index to be accessed, which should result in a lower chance of future problems.

Somehow it seems that the patch to score acacia and pine trees got lost. This functionality has now been restored.

Both the stretching frame scraping and pine/acacia tree scoring have been given animations for better immersion.

#### Version 1.5.21
Removed Wildcraft Trees compatibility. It seemed to be causing major issues for people.

#### Version 1.5.20
Hide sacks were broken with the release of 1.5.19. This version fixes the silliness that I had done to cause that.

The whole brain tanning process has been extended to better match the vanilla method. In game, soaking hides will take 48 hours, braining hides will take 92 hours, and smoking hides takes an additional 10 hours in a firepit.

Added two new config options to allow players to adjust the timing of the brain tanning process. `BrainsPerBrainingSolutionCraft` allows you to choose how many brains are needed for a 10mL batch of solution, and `BrainedHideSmokingSeconds` allows you to determine how many real-world seconds it takes to smoke the hides. The default 1200 is 20 minutes.

Fixed a compatibility issue that prevented the hide sacks from being picked up with CarryOn.

#### Version 1.5.19 

Wood Splitting
Similar to vanilla support beams, Ancient Tools beams can be used to create the rickety translocator

Sound effects have been added for when the player smacks wedges into debarked logs. One sound for stone wedges, another for metal wedges.

When splitting logs, vanilla beams will now be the default drop. They have far more use in the game. Ancient Tools beams can still be made for use as ground storage.


Mortar and Pestle
The codes for powdered charcoal, borax, sylvite, sulfur had been changed in VS 1.20.0. The patches relating to the mortar have been adjusted for this. 

The seashell files had been moved in VS 1.20.0. The patch relating to the mortar has been adjusted for this.

Crushed iron and calcined flint are new grindables in Vintage Story 1.20.0. Patches have been made for these for the mortar.


Pitch
A nasty Harmony startup crash has been resolved related to a function no longer existing that Ancient Tools was modifying. Ancient Tools now accesses 'BEBehaviorTemperatureSensitive' to run the firepit fireproof fuel check to allow firepits to remain lit during rainfall if pitch is used as the fuel source.

As a result of the powdered charcoal code change, same as above, the recipe for pitch pots needed tweaking.


Brain Tanning
Plain leather has had its code changed, therefore the smoked leather recipe needed tweaking.

Shears can now be used to cut smoked leather into plain leather. Why not?

Vintage Story 1.20.0 now lets hides rot. The stretching frame needed to be adjusted slightly to allow for this behaviour. When a hide rots on the frame, the rot will pop off and drop on the floor.

Salted hides, a new item in VS 1.20.0, can now be placed on the stretching frames. Water sacks were also given a salted version.

New animals were added to the base game. Brains SHOULD drop for all the ones that should be expected to(the adults, maybe larger baby animals) without my need to change patches. A patch for brain drops have been added to the tamed elk, however.

A compatibility patch for Hide and Fabric has been added to allow all bears to drop brains. Hide and Fabric has not yet been updated to 1.20.0


Bark Bread
Jugs can now be used to craft bark dough


Carts
All of the new storage vessels have been given patches that enable them to be placed on the cart.

Aged variants of the normal, golden, and owl chest were added to the game and now these have patches to be used on the cart as well. Also fixed a crash related to this, hopefully doesn't cause any futher issues.

The reed basket has had its file moved. The patch for it has been updated to address this.


Misc
Ancient Tools blocks that use the Display Inventory class as a basis should now be more robust and resilient to texture atlas/texture not found crashing. Mortar, Stretching Frame, Curing Rack, basically anything that shows what it contains, except the carts. These blocks should now show the '?' block texture instead of crashing out when something goes wrong. 

The OLD module for Wildcraft has had its content removed. The NEW Wildcraft stuff should now have compatibility, unless much has changed semi-recently. Thanks for Tarot for doing this, a while back!

Removed storage flags for salted meat and brains- it was preventing them from being placed in cooking pots for making meals.

#### Version 1.5.18
Salted meats and brains now have storage flags, letting them be stored in agricultural-only containers. 

Reduced brain meal satiation to 300

Adjusted the file path for reed baskets in their cart property patches. The path was changed in VS 1.19.0. This should prevent crashes from carts that had baskets placed in VS 1.18.

Fixed a crash that occurred when attacking debarked logs with empty hands.

Fixed an issue that made it so that debarked logs could not be broken with an axe(or other means)

#### Version 1.5.17
Fixed an issue where the hammer wedge smacking wasn't being called on the server.

Adjusted a patch on the vanilla torch to properly point to the file location. File location was moved in 1.19.5.

Fixed the CarryOn patch for pitch and salve pots. They should be carry-able again.

#### Version 1.5.16
Powdered charcoal(vanilla) can be used to craft pitch pots in the crafting grid, just like old Ancient Tools powdered charcoal could be.

Powdered charcoal(vanilla) can be used to convert cooking pots into pitch pots just like the old Ancient Tools powdered charcoal could be.

#### Version 1.5.15
Reverted the decision to disable vanilla glue cooking recipes by default. Toolworks has special use of it. If you have already installed one of the 1.19.4+ versions of Ancient Tools you will need to revert this change yourself by setting `DisableVanillaGlue` to false in your config file.

#### Version 1.5.14
Fixed a null reference crash caused by a harmony patch to the Authorative Animation class in vanilla.

#### Version 1.5.13
Pitch sticks can now be used in place of glue to repair clutter! With torch held in off-hand, sneak and interact the pitch against a clutter box to fix it up

Hammers can now be used in place of mallets for smacking wedges. Might as well use the more versatile tool!

Stretching frames have had their hide models updated to better suit the vanilla model changes.

Brained/Smoked hides have had their models/textures changed to match vanilla standards.

Fixed an issue where cart inventories would be invisible upon world load.

Fixed an issue where collectibles with no attributes, when used on the mortar, would cause a crash.

Fixed an issue where the SplitLog class would not pass along the dropQuantityModifier that was modified by behaviors of other mods.

Oak and acacia bark can now be used in the crafting grid to create empty salve pots.

Pitch/salve pots now become residue covered when used in their respective crafting processes. 

Ancient Tools powdered charcoal no longer shows in the creative grid and is no longer craftable. It has been replaced by the vanilla version of the same name.

Disabled the vanilla crafting method for glue. Instead, Ancient Tools uses its own pitch in a more convenient and more common method for repairing clutter!

#### Version 1.5.12
Updated Ancient Tools for Vintage Story 1.19.0+ compatibility.
NOTE: Many tweaks still need to be made so that certain things match up more nicely with the new vanilla first person mode

Fixed several minor mistakes in lang files.

Recipe disables for vanilla support beam and debarked logs will no longer run when InDappledGroves is installed to avoid throwing a debug log warning.

Fixed an issue that prevented carts from being repaired.

Fixed an issue that interfered with other mods attempting to use interactions with the saw.

Removed brain drops from gazelle calves

#### Version 1.5.11
Fixed a spelling mistake within the sulfur patch which caused clients to crash when grinding sulfur with a mortar and pestle. Thanks to Iphour for the report!

Potentially fixed a crash that would occurr intermittently whenever the mortar tried to grab a texture from the item a grindable would grind into. groundItemstack was not being properly set on the clientside. Again, thank you Iphour for the report!

Apparently grindable meshes in the mortar were not being properly synced between clients. Thing should now look proper to everyone.

Added a dependsOn property to pantherinae brain patches. They were attempting to patch even when the pantherinae mod was not installed.

#### Version 1.5.10
Wedges can now be smithed on an anvil. This should allow them to be made from end-game materials. Thanks for the report, Alatyr!

Revisited the Primitive Survival patch for hides to address a compatibility issue that has cropped up again with recent versions of PS. Reported by many folks on the ModDB, namely, Poompers, Massive_Legend, XeneWarf, and gndrneutralnoun

Added a dependsOn property to capreoline brain patches. They were attempting to patch even when the caprepline mod was not installed.

Dynamic texture paths have been moved from cart item/entity texture properties and placed into attributes to prevent a false warning of textures not found in the client log. Adjusted some code logic to accomodate this. Thanks Diometus for the report!

#### Version 1.5.9
Updated the Russian translation of the mod. Thank you SO MUCH to Vulpeep and DonBitcoin who contributed extensive efforts to make this translation wonderfully polished.

Updated the English lang file slightly to replace player action words with icon prompts where applicable.

The mod now uses VS 1.18.8 rc-1 as a dependancy properly now. The mod was built with .Net7 and requires .Net7 versions of Vintage Story. If you're using 1.18.8 or later, you're good.

#### Version 1.5.8 
Ancient Tools is now built upon the .Net7 framework and will be the only framework supported going forward.

Metal mallets have been added! They can be crafted by smithing or smelting. Improvement requested by Alatyr, thank you!

Mallets can now be placed in ground storage.

Reed baskets and all vessel variants(except raw) can now be placed on carts for transport. gndrneutralnoun requested additional storage for carts, so now they're here ^_^. If there's more that I missed, please request. Crates will hopefully be a thing soon, too.

Salt crystals from Expanded Foods can be ground in the mortar. This compatibility was requested by PervertChimp, thanks!

Added electrum, nickel and cupronickel chamberstick variants. These variants were requested by Ruyeex, thanks!

Fixed an issue where spruce flour would appear in-game when Wildcraft Trees was not installed.

Hopefully fixed a crash that occurred when XSkills was installed. Repair/Deconstruct collectible behaviors for carts use 'handling = PreventSubsequent' now in hopes that default code will not be called. Issue reported by RogueRaiden on GitHub, thank you!

Updated the Japanese translation for Ancient Tools! Thanks, Macoto Hino!

#### Version 1.5.7
Fixed some missing textures on Purpleheart and Ebony bark baskets.

Fixed a mistake that resulted in spruce bark grinding properties overwriting the properties for all other types of wood.

Fixed an issue where behaviors were not being applied to salve pots when CarryOn/Carry Capacity was installed

#### Version 1.5.6
Cart owners(the player who placed the cart originally) now always have permission to access their cart, and to deconstruct it. NOTE: A new cart needs to be placed for this to take effect!

Carts now remember the previous player hauler. When placed, even when in other player claims, it can be picked up and/or have its inventory accessed by that player.

Fixed a crash that occurred when deconstructing carts.

Fixed an issue where some Wildcraft Trees recipes were enabled even when Wildcraft Trees was not installed.

Fixed an issue where In Dappled Groves dried spruce bark(from Wildcraft Trees) was not given a grindingProps attribute, preventing it from being ground in a quern.

#### Version 1.5.5

##### Ancient Tools 
Optimized ItemAttributeVariant items(cart hand-held objects) and cart entities. They are now only assigned textures that they will actually use.

Massive optimization for carts. Carts now go 'dormant' when they don't need to visually update, resulting in far fewer calls to the GPU. Carts also update their mesh when possible instead of generating new meshes each render frame. Massive FPS improvement!

Carts and their inventories now respect claims. No more grand theft auto!

Carts cannot be deconstructed by players that do not have use/build permissions while in a claim.

Fixed an issue that prevented Acacia wood from being carvable for a resin source.

Added compatibility for the Reignited mod. Extinct pitch torches can be held against other fire sources to light the torch.

Added compatibility for Fauna of the Stone Age mods. Thanks Weathersong for your Capreolinae patches!

Narrow trees can now be stripped, too! Show off by crafting bark baskets using rare Greenspire Cypress bark.

Oak and Acacia bark can now be used to create healing salves, too!

Fixed a crash that occurred whenever a player tried to interact with the stretching frame with a collectible that does not have attributes.

##### In Dappled Groves Compatibility
Note: Some new Ancient Tools additions may be unavailable with Dappled Groves installed. For example, narrow log stripping

Disabled the Ancient Tools adze molds. Adze heads are only craftable via smithing in Dappled Groves.

Adjusted the mortarProperties object in the bark compatibility patch to work with the new Ancient Tools mortar system.

Only soaked bark can be used for healing salve crafting.

Removed all strippedlog patches. They're not need now that both mods use the vanilla debarked logs!

##### Wildcraft Trees Compatibility
Bark, Bark Baskets, Stretching Frames, Curing Racks, Beams, Wheels, and Carts can all now be crafted using the pretty wood variants from Wildcraft Trees!

Willow, Alder and Bride In White narrow trees have narrow log variants that can be stripped for their bark.

Douglas Fir and Spruce can be scored using a knife to create a leaking log for a consistent source of resin.

#### Version 1.5.3
Fixed an issue with the Japanese language file not loading(courtesy of Macoto Hino)

Added Japanese translations for Very Aged beams and Very Aged Rotten beams(courtesy of Macoto Hino)

Fixed an issue where resin would not appear on directionalresin leaking logs if decor(moss) was hanging on the block that was carved.

#### Version 1.5.2
Ancient Tools should now be fully compatible with Vintage Story 1.18.

The Ancient Tools mortar has been switched from a BlockEntityDisplay object to the Ancient Tools proprietary DisplayInventory object to be on-par with all other inventories in the mod that show their inventory.

The mortar no longer uses GrindingProps to determine its grinding result. Instead, it's all controlled through an attribute attached to the collectible called 'mortarProperties'. Shapes, textures, quantities can all be adjusted here.

Removed many duplicate shapes from the mortar resources folder that are no longer required due to the above changes.

Added crafting recipes to switch between Ancient Tools beams and vanilla support beams. Both can be used interchangably in crafting recipes. This way, players can retain the GroundStorage capabilities of AT beams while still having the ability to build creatively with the vanilla beams.

Fine-tuned the repair/deconstruct behaviors for carts and gave the processes some proper sounds.

Ancient Tools now removes grid crafting recipes for vanilla beams and debarked logs. These can be enabled again by modifying two new config variables, 'InWorldBeamCraftingOnly' and 'AdzeStrippingOnly'.

Ancient Tools stripped logs have been removed. Adze tools now strip logs into the vanilla debarked logs. Remaps have been made that should convert all existing stripped log blocks to debarked logs.

Modified the Ancient Tools beam and beam ground storage stack to use vanilla debarked textures.

Hide and salted meat transforms in the fire pit have been altered to accomodate the firepit model rework.  

The command for removing mobile storage debuff was modified to work with the new Vintage Story command API.

#### Version 1.5.1
Solved an incompatibility between Ancient Tools and Chisel Tools. Ancient Tools wedges were adopting the wedge functionality from the Chisel Tools mod.

Fixed an issue that prevented stripped logs from breaking when in survival mode.

Mitigated an issue where carts would suddenly 'fall off' a player if they were moving too quickly. This was most common when jumping off cliffs. This can still happen...like when a player dies, as is intended, but should be much less likely through regular gameplay.

Carts shouldn't despawn unless they are destroyed or burned. I couldn't spend time thoroughly testing this for this release. If they do still randomly despawn, please let me know!

Added a command that can be used by server owners/op'd users that can remove the mobile storage debuff for themselves or another player. '/removemobilestoragedebuff [playername]'

Fixed an issue where the player would have the cart movement debuff even when the cart detached.

Fixed an issue where the player would have the cart movement debuff if they logged off with a cart attached, then logged back in.

Fixed an issue where, when the player placed a cart, the cart was not removed from their inventory.

Players can also log off then log back in to clear any mobile storage debuffs in the case that a command can't be used or does not work.

#### Version 1.5.0
Carts have been introduced to Ancient Tools! They can attach to players and follow them around. Chests can be placed on carts to give them storage capabilities and can be used to transport items from place to place.

Two new tools have been created, wedges and mallets. Wedges can be made from stone or metals, whilst mallets only have a stone variant.

A new in-world crafting system for creating beams has been introduced. The aforementioned wedges can be placed atop upright standing stripped logs and smacked into the wood using a mallet to split the wood into beams. Beams are required to craft both wheels and carts.

Wheels can now be crafted and are required to craft carts.

A simplistic(unpolished) deconstruction mechanic has been introduced that will quickly deconstruct in-world carts. Simply break apart the cart with a saw.

A simplistic(unpolished) repair mechanic has been introduced that can be used to repair carts. Simply hold boards that match the type of the cart in your off-hand and interact with the cart with a mallet to repair.

Added additional information to all Ancient Tools collectibles that will help identify their purpose. Placed block info and hover tooltip.

Added a Crafted By link to each crafted object handbook entry in Ancient Tools that directs players to the appropriate handbook carfting guide.

Created a generic class that will handle like-functionality between different MobileStorage objects.

Created a generic class that can be used to display different item types without creating excessive numbers of variants(think of it as a personalized clutter class)

Modified the display of the pitch container to be more flexible, allowing other modded items to appear as possible pitch ingredients.

#### Version 1.3.6
The mod can now be enjoyed in Japanese, courtesy of a translation offered by Macoto Hino!

Beeswax and fat patches should no longer overwrite the vanilla game attributes. This should allow the items to be placed on shelves again.
