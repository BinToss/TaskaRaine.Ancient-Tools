### Change Log

#### Version 1.1.0
---Curing Rack
Implements a salted meat item that is intended to be cured on a rack. Redmeat, poultry and bushmeant. Can be cooked.

Implements a curing rack block made of any wood type that can be visually extended across multple blocks and/or hung with the proper support.

Bone curing hooks can be crafted and placed on the rack, then meat can be added.

Rack meat perish rate is modified based on the environment in which it is placed... will need a controlled environment to properly cure.

Meats attached to the rack will cure over 20 ingame days 

---Mortar and Pestle
Fixed a rare crash that occurred when an item rots in the mortar, and is then attempted to be ground down.

Pestle rotation now syncs upon starting and finishing a grind.

#### Version 1.0.3
Particle colours should now sync between all players.

FPS while interacting with the mortar is vastly improved.

The pestle while in the mortar has its own renderer which means the animation is far smoother.

Pestle animation should be seen by all players(rotation is not synced, however).


#### Version 1.0.2
Compiled mod to be compatible with Vintage Story 1.15.0

New grindable items introduced in Vintage Story 1.15.0 are grindable in the mortar(previously implemented, but inaccessible)

Fixed an exploit where players could insert old foods into the mortar then pull out fresh food. 


#### Version 1.0.1
Adds a chalk stone shape for the mortar, forgotten with the first release.

The mortar now finds shapes based on the the FULL item code, not just first and last code parts.


#### Version 1.0.0
Initial implementation of the mortar/pestle.
