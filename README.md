### Change Log

#### Version 1.0.2
Compiled mod to be compatible with Vintage Story 1.15.0

New grindable items introduced in Vintage Story 1.15.0 are grindable in the mortar(previously implemented, but inaccessible)

Fixed an exploit where players could insert old foods into the mortar then pull out fresh food. 

#### Version 1.0.1
Adds a chalk stone shape for the mortar, forgotten with the first release.

The mortar now finds shapes based on the the FULL item code, not just first and last code parts.

#### Version 1.0.0
Initial implementation of the mortar/pestle.
