"<font weight='bold' align='center'>Ancient Tools Guide</font><br>
<font weight='bold'>Mortar and Pestle</font>
The classic <a href=\'handbook://block-ancienttools:mortar-granite\'>mortar</a> and <a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:pestle-basalt\'>pestle</a>. These two tools have been in use in some form since the Paleolithic era for grinding substances such as spices and oats.

To use these items in Vintage Story you must first craft each. Place the mortar on the ground then insert the pestle with <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon>. Insert any grindable item with <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> then <hk>shift</hk> and hold <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> to begin grinding away!

<font weight='bold'>Adze</font>
This <a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:adze-copper\'>adze</a>, introduced in the Neolithic era, was a tool commonly used by ancient carpenters to shape wood into various objects or architecture. In its current implementation in the Ancient Tools mod, the adze is used to strip <a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:bark-oak\'>bark</a> from trees.  

To create an adze, an <a href=\'handbooksearch://adze head\'>adze head</a> must first be created either through stone <a href=\"handbook://craftinginfo-knapping\">knapping</a>, <a href=\"handbook://craftinginfo-smelting\">smelting</a> or <a href=\"handbook://craftinginfo-smithing\">smithing</a>. Craft the resulting adze head with a stick and you'll now have yourself a handy tool for collecting bark! Approach the nearest tree with adze in hand then <hk>shift</hk> and hold <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> to begin stripping away.

Stone adze heads can also be crafted with bone for an extra sturdy tool!

More details about the uses for bark and stripped logs can be found in the <a href=\"handbook://ancienttools-quickstart-guide-barkstripping\">bark stripping guide</a>.

<font weight='bold'>Curing Rack</font>
Curing meats with <a href=\'handbook://item-salt\'>salt</a> is a centuries-old practice of preservation. This requires a carefully controlled environment to ensure the meat doesn't rot before the meat is cured. A cellar is recommended!

A <a href=\'handbooksearch://curing rack\'>curing rack</a> can be equipped with two <a href=\'handbooksearch://bone hook\'>hooks</a> with <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon>. Hang any variety of salted meat(<a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:saltedmeat-redmeat-raw\'>redmeat</a>,<a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:saltedmeat-poultry-raw\'>poultry</a>,<a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:saltedmeat-bushmeat-raw\'>bushmeat</a>) and wait until your delicious meat is perfectly cured!

Salted meats can also be cooked in a firepit for a quick meal solution.	

<font weight='bold'>Native American Tanning</font>

Pre-contact Native American cultures used a different technique for tanning animal hides than colonial European settlers to create their iconic leather products.

Ancient Tools implements a simplified version of this technique to give you another means of crafting leather! Want to give it a try? Visit the <a href=\"handbook://ancienttools-quickstart-guide-tanning\">Native American Tanning Guide</a>.  

<font weight='bold'>Pitch</font>

<a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:pitch-ball\'>Pitch</a> is a sticky black substance produced by combining then melting finely <a href=\'handbook://item-powder-charcoal-raw\'>powdered charcoal</a>, tree <a href=\'handbook://item-resin\'>resin</a>, and various fibrous materials such as <a href=\'handbook://item-drygrass\'>dry grass</a> or dried animal feces. 

This material is exceptionally waterproof and sticky. Historically, it has been used to caulk the seams of wooden sailing vessels or to seal containers, such as food <a href=\'handbook://block-crock-burned-east\'>crocks</a>. Ancient Tools takes advantage of its waterproof property by allowing you to use firepits, pit kilns, and forges exposed to the elements whenever pitch is used as the fuel. 

Additionally, pitch can be used to create long-lasting, brightly burning <a href=\'handbook://block-ancienttools:pitchtorch-extinct-up\'>torches</a> that won't be extinguished by rain. It can also be used to create <a href=\'handbooksearch://Chamberstick with Pitch\'>chambersticks</a> as a permenant lighting solution similar to oil lamps.    

<a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:pitch-stick\'>Stick pitch</a> is also a convenient alternative to <a href=\'handbook://item-glueportion-pitch-hot\'>glue</a> for repairing various clutter discovered throughout the world. Simply hold a lit <a href=\'handbooksearch://torch\'>torch</a> in your offhand, <hk>shift</hk> to sneak, and interact with <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> to fix it!

A detailed explanation of how to produce pitch can be found in the <a href=\"handbook://ancienttools-quickstart-guide-pitch\">Pitch Guide</a>.

Note: Since resin is so integral to Ancient Tools pitch production, a system has been implemented that allows knives to scrape pine and acacia trees to create leaking logs. This system can be disabled in the mod config files.

<font weight='bold'>Mobile Storage</font>

There will always be a need to transport things from place to place. Cultures from ancient Greece, Egypt, Assyria, and many others all envisioned various mobile transport and storage solutions to fit the needs of their people.

Hand-drawn <a href=\'handbooksearch://cart\'>carts</a> were among the very first forms of man-made transport. They were often little more than a set of planks or a box placed upon a frame with wheels attached. Cheap, and often accessible to the common folk.

Similarly, hand-drawn <a href=\'handbooksearch://cart\'>carts</a> are the very first type of mobile storage available in Ancient Tools! 

More details about how to create each of these primitive vehicles and information about their usage can be found in the <a href=\"handbook://ancienttools-quickstart-feature-mobilestorage\">Mobile Storage</a> segment.

After you've aquired an <a href=\'handbooksearch://adze\'>adze</a>, it's time to get stripping!

The <a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:bark-oak\'>tree bark</a> that you collect can be used for a variety of different purposes. Bark can make for an excellent firestarter in place of firewood. Or, it can be woven to create cute little <a href=\'handbooksearch://bark basket\'>bark baskets</a> to place things in.

Many barks such as <a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:bark-birch\'>birch bark</a> and <a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:bark-pine\'>pine bark</a> are a special arboreal resource in that they possess some unique properties that we can take advantage of. 

The inner layer of bark from many trees is edible and can be ground down into a <a href=\'handbooksearch://flour\'>flour</a> that can then be baked into <a href=\'handbooksearch://bread\'>bread</a>. This was a Scandanavian tradition of the indigenous Sami culture. 

There are also many barks which have medical properties which were used to treat various ailments. Have a look at the <a href=\"handbook://ancienttools-quickstart-guide-salve\">salve preparation guide</a> if you're interested in taking advantage of them!

<font weight='bold' align='center'>Ancient Tools Salve Creation Guide</font><br>
Tree bark has had many various uses throughout history. Many trees, such as <a href=\'handbooksearch://birch\'>birch</a>, <a href=\'handbooksearch://pine\'>pine</a>, <a href=\'handbooksearch://oak\'>oak</a>, and <a href=\'handbooksearch://acacia\'>acacia</a> have various beneficial healing properties. Birch is most commonly used to ease joint pain, whilst pine is most commonly used to reduce inflammation.

<a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:salveportion\'>Salves</a> are sometimes created by homesteaders then applied to the skin to take advantage of these properties. To create a salve with Ancient Tools, first, you must convert two cooking pots into <a href=\'handbook://block-ancienttools:salvepot-empty\'>empty salve containers</a>. This can be done by holding <hk>shift</hk> then pressing <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> with a salve ingredient(bark, <a href=\'handbook://item-fat\'>fat</a>, or <a href=\'handbook://item-beeswax\'>beeswax</a>) or by crafting a <a href=\'handbook://block-ckaypot-burned\'>cooking pot</a> in the grid with a medicinal bark.

Place both <a href=\'handbook://block-ancienttools:salvepot-empty\'>empty containers</a> on the ground. Fill one with a single type of bark and <a href=\'handbook://item-fat\'>fat</a>, then the other with <a href=\'handbook://item-beeswax\'>beeswax</a>. Heat both in a firepit to convert them to prepared versions. 

Finally, place one prepared container on the ground then <hk>shift</hk> and hold <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> with the other container in hand to pour them together. Congratulations, you made a healing salve! <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> the finished salve to extract a <a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:salveportion\'>portion</a> that will heal over time when used.

Empty salve containers can be placed in the crafting grid to convert them back into cooking pots.

Grab your nearest <a href=\'handbooksearch://raw hide\'>raw hide</a> and let's get started!

To make removal of undesirable fleshy bits easier, hides were tied into sacks with the flesh side inward and filled with water to soften the flesh. To do this, simply <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> your hide on a water source or craft a <a href=\'handbook://block-ancienttools:hidewatersack-raw-huge\'>sack</a> using a filled <a href=\'handbook://block-woodbucket\'>bucket</a> of water.

Place the sack on the ground someplace and wait. When it is ready, it will become a <a href=\'handbooksearch://soaked hide water sack\'>soaked hide sack</a>.

While waiting it could be useful to craft up a <a href=\'handbooksearch://stretching frame\'>stretching frame</a> in preparation! Simply take the hide when it's ready and stretch it on the frame.

Using a trusty <a href=\'handbooksearch://knife\'>knife</a>, press <hk>shift</hk> and begin scraping away hair, fat and other undesirable materials from the hide using <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon>. 

The next step might sound disgusting, but it's essential to create a soft, pliable leather. We need to create a 'braining solution' to soak our hide in. Any <a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:animalbrain\'>animal brain</a> will do. Take the brain and combine it with 10L of water in a barrel to create the solution. 

Now, take the hide from the stretching frame and seal it in the barrel with the braining solution you just made. This will take some time.

When the hide has been thoroughly <a href=\'handbook://item-hide-soaked-huge\'>soaked</a> in solution, the next step is to smoke the hide. This makes the hide water resistant and gives the leather its iconic golden color. Hang your hide over a fire pit and wait for it to become a <a href=\'handbook://item-hide-smoked-huge\'>smoked hide</a>.

Now, the final part! Take your smoked hide and, using a knife, carefully cut it into strips of <a href=\'handbook://item-leather\'>leather</a>. This is performed in the crafting grid.

<a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:pitch-ball\'>Pitch</a> was once a highly saught after resource for its versatility. It could be used as a glue, a sealant, a fuel, and for many other purposes.

There was no 'one way' to create pitch. Many different resources were combined for similar results. However, with Ancient Tools, you will need some <a href=\'handbook://item-charcoal\'>charcoal</a>, <a href=\'handbook://item-resin\'>resin</a>, and <a href=\'handbook://item-drygrass\'>dry grass</a> on hand for this process.

To get started, you must grind two pieces of charcoal into <a href=\'handbook://item-powder-charcoal-raw\'>powdered charcoal</a> using a <a href=\'handbooksearch://mortar\'>mortar</a> and <a href=\'handbooksearch://pestle\'>pestle</a>, or any other means of grinding items. Take one piece of powdered charcoal and interact with a cooking pot using <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> to transform the pot into an <a href=\'handbook://block-ancienttools:pitchpot-empty\'>empty pitch container</a>.

Next, fill up the container using <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> with 2 parts <a href=\'handbook://item-powder-charcoal-raw\'>powdered charcoal</a>, 4 parts <a href=\'handbook://item-resin\'>resin</a>, and 1 part <a href=\'handbook://item-drygrass\'>dry grass</a>. When the container is properly filled, it will convert into an <a href=\'handbook://block-ancienttools:pitchpot-unmixed\'>unprepared pitch mixture</a>.

Now, simply pick up the mixture and heat it in the nearest firepit to create <a href=\'handbook://block-ancienttools:pitchpot-finishedpitchinventory\'>prepared pitch</a>. When it's been finished, you can place the pot on the ground and take pieces of pitch by using a <a href=\'handbook://item-stick\'>stick</a>.

Sometimes, wooden logs are just too large to be useful. Wood splitting, otherwise known as cleaving, was a common technique for shaping wood into more usable dimensions during the Neolithic era right up until the Pre-Industrial era.

To accomplish this task, many cultures drove <a href=\'handbooksearch://wedge\'>wedges</a> into the grain of the wood using a <a href=\'handbooksearch://wedge\'>mallet</a> to create smaller, yet sturdy wooden products.

Similarly, <a href=\'handbooksearch://wedge\'>wedges</a>, either crafted from stone or forged, can be placed into any upright-standing <a href=\'handbooksearch://debarked\'>stripped log</a> using <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> then smacked with a <a href=\'handbooksearch://wedge\'>mallet</a> with <icon name='leftmousebutton'></icon>. As each quarter is split away, a fancy new <a href=\'handbooksearch://beam\'>beam</a> will be yours for the taking!

<a href=\'handbooksearch://beam\'>Beams</a> are an essential construction component for <a href=\'handbooksearch://wheel\'>wheels</a> and <a href=\"handbook://ancienttools-quickstart-feature-mobilestorage\">mobile storage</a> from Ancient Tools.

<font weight='bold' align='center'>Mobile Storage</font><br>

The wheel is considered by most to be the most impactful invention of human history. It is possible that the device was conceived during the late Neolithic era but, only when metal tools were more abundantly available during the Bronze era, did the wheel have a significant worldwide impact.

The wheel singlehandedly revolutionized the idea of transportation across vast distances. A whole new wave of inventions were constructed to deliver objects and people from one place to another. 

Ancient Tools looks to incorporate a wide variety of transportation options inspired by history.

<font weight='bold' align='center'>Carts</font><br>

<a href=\'handbooksearch://cart\'>Carts</a> are simple two-wheeled constructions primarily made of wooden <a href=\'handbooksearch://board\'>boards</a> and <a href=\'handbooksearch://beam\'>beams</a> that may be all a wandering trader needs in life. 

To build a <a href=\'handbooksearch://cart\'>cart</a> of your own, all you need is a single <a href=\'handbook://block-woodenaxle-ud'>axle</a>, a couple of <a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:wheel-oak\'>wheels</a>, a handful of <a href=\'handbook://block-game:supportbeam-oak\'>beams</a>, and a bunch of <a href=\'handbook://item-plank-oak\'>boards</a> arranged neatly in the crafting grid!

Place the resulting cart item on the ground...and now you have a handy little device that can follow you around wherever you go, hauling all your goodies. 

To use the cart for its intended purpose, it will need to have an empty <a href=\'handbooksearch://wooden chest\'>chest</a> inventory placed on it with <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon>. With an inventory set on the cart, it can now be accessed with <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> for storage purposes.

To move the cart from place to place, simply pick it up by pressing <hk>shift</hk> and interacting with it using <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon>. Wherever you travel, your cart will closely follow! To put the cart down, simply repeat the same sequences of actions you used to pick up the cart.

When empty, cart inventories can also be removed! Simply press <hk>ctrl</hk>, then <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> with an empty hand to remove it from the cart.
