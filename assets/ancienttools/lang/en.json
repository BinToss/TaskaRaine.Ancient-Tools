"<font weight='bold' align='center'>Ancient Tools Guide</font><br>
<font weight='bold'>Mortar and Pestle</font>
The classic <a href=\'handbook://block-ancienttools:mortar-granite\'>mortar</a> and <a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:pestle-basalt\'>pestle</a>. These two tools have been in use in some form since the Paleolithic era for grinding substances such as spices and oats.

To use these items in Vintage Story you must first craft each. Place the mortar on the ground then insert the pestle with <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon>. Insert any grindable item with <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> then crouch and hold <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> to begin grinding away!

<font weight='bold'>Curing Rack</font>
Curing meats with <a href=\'handbook://item-salt\'>salt</a> is a centuries-old practice of preservation. This requires a carefully controlled environment to ensure the meat doesn't rot before the meat is cured. A cellar is recommended!

A <a href=\'handbooksearch://curing rack\'>curing rack</a> can be equipped with two <a href=\'handbooksearch://curing hook\'>hooks</a> with <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon>. Hang any variety of salted meat(<a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:saltedmeat-redmeat-raw\'>redmeat</a>,<a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:saltedmeat-poultry-raw\'>poultry</a>,<a href=\'handbook://item-ancienttools:saltedmeat-bushmeat-raw\'>bushmeat</a>) and wait until your delicious meat is perfectly cured!

Salted meats can also be cooked in a firepit for a quick meal solution.
